# Simulation of NLNM combat

[Reasoning](https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/the-struggle-continues-anew.xyz)

## Proposed technology stack

* Front End

https://threejs.org/

Allows for building maximally realistic, fully custom experience

* Backend

  - Development:

     NodeJS (running AIRport)

  - Production:

     AIRport

     https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRport

       1. High performance regionally-decentralized platform.

       2. Hierarchical compartmentalized storage - individual combat stored in (?2 duplicating?) Repository(ies), separate Repository for each combat unit, in hierarchy.

       3. Allows for subsequent replay and reproduction of events.
